          I grew up in Japan speaking English at home. I loved using technology with elegant user interfaces from a young age. I was enchanted by the "dock" in Mac OS X, the multi-touch display, and HTML5/CSS3.
        </p>
        <p>
          I went to Waseda's Department of Intermedia Art and Science to study how to spark wonder through creativity and technology. I continue to explore new interactions with technology as a master's student.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll be graduating in September 2022, and I'm looking to get a human interaction or user experience job.
